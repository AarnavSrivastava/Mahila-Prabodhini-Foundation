                managerial risk-bearing capability and of course patience. We graduate them into thrift and
                credit groups (women's self-help groups). Each group consists of 10-15 rural women from the
                same socio-economic background. They mobilize thrift and deposit in saving account- Group
                saving account. Initially, they solved their emergent need from their own mobilized capital.
                Later they move towards micro income generation activities for which they need capacity
                building entrepreneurship development program. After taking Entrepreneurship training, they
                set up a tiny production unit but they still have to face marketing problems. We, therefore,
                started the concept of Prabodhini Gram Bazaar (Rural Mart).
